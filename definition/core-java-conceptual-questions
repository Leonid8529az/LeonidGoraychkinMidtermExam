-------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is class?
A. A blueprint
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is object?
A. An instance of the class
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the entry point of an application?
A. public static void main(String args[])
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why main is static?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. Path is for setting path for java tools. Classpath is for setting path of java classes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Interface - variables are declared final by default
- members are public by default
- uses keyword implements
- can not be instantiated
Abstract - may contain non-final data type
- may have private, protected methods
- uses keyword extends
- extends another class and implements multiple interfaces
- can not be instantiated, but can be invoked in main
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. We can't. We use classes with main methods to extends and implement these classes, and then we
override the methods, or use Abstract methods

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. Java doesn't support multiple inheritance, only multi-level. It happens because
each class can not implement more, than class.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Method overloading is a method, that has the same name, but different parameters. It happens during
the compile time
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. Exception is an error, happening during compile time. It can be handled by the try - catch block
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. Static keyword means that the variable or the method belongs to the class, not to the object.
Static methods can only use static variables from inside the class.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. Final means unchanged, impossible to modify. Final variables and methods can not be changed
by other objects of classes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is final, finally and finalize?
A. Final refers to the variables or methods, means unchanged, non-modified
Finally is a default keyword for try-catch block
Finally is the keyword for garbage collection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a constructor?
A. Is a block of code, similar to the method, which is used to create objects
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. YES!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. A default constructor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. This keyword is a link between local variable and the global variable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. Super keyword is keyword, that can invoke the properties of the superclass.
We can access parents class properties such as methods and variables.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is JVM platform independent?
A. YES!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What version of java are you using?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is JAR stand for?
A. Java ARchive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. JDK - is a software development kit
- platform dependent
- contains development tools
JVM - is a program to run bytecode
- not platform dependent
- doesn't contain tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JRE - is an environment within which JVM runs
- contains classes and libraries
- is not used for development purposes
- is used for running java code
JVM -is a program to run bytecode
- is a part of the JRE
- does not contain tools
- is used for development purposes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is compile time and run time?
A. Compile time is a period when the code gets transformed into a bytecode
Run time is a period, during which the program is running
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is heap?
A. Dynamic flexible memory used by java for variables and instances
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

How java manage it's memory?
A. It uses either heap memory or stacks, or it uses the garbage collector
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A. String - is a class for using chain of characters
- is immutable

when to use transient variable in java?
A. At the time of serialization
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. While loop firstly checks the condition, then executes the body. Do..while loop executes the
body of the loop, then checks the condition

Garbage collection removes the unused objects
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. No
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A. Stack - is linear data structure
- accesses local variables
- variables can't be resized
- memory will never become fragmented
Heap is a hierarchical data structure
- can become fragmented
- allows to access variables globally
- variables can be resized
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A. Is a program, that is used to examine the behavior of methods, classes and interfaces
It is useful, because it does this at the run time
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A. It controls the access to multiple threads to any shared resources
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Framework?
A. Bodies of the codes, used by the developers to create apps using the java language
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is dependency injection in java?
A. Passing of the dependency to the project, which is used by other developers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. Static binding is binding where name can be associated with the class during compilation time
Dynamic binding is binding where name can be associated with the class during execution time
